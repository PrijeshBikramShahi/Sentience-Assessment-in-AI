# Fuzzy Logic Implementation for Sentience Level Estimation

This repository contains Python code that implements a fuzzy logic system using scikit-fuzzy to estimate the sentience level based on three input variables: behavior complexity, human interaction effectiveness, and learning adaptation.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have scikit-fuzzy installed:

```bash
!pip install scikit-fuzzy
```
## Usage
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrijeshBikramShahi/Sentience-Assessment-in-AI.git
```
Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd Sentience-Assessment-in-AI
```
Run the fuzzy logic simulation:

Open the Python script sentience_level_fuzzy.py and execute it. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

Input Variables:

Behavior Complexity: Ranges from 0 to 10, defining the complexity of behavior.
Human Interaction Effectiveness: Ranges from 0 to 10, indicating how effective interactions with humans are.
Learning Adaptation: Ranges from 0 to 10, representing the adaptability and learning capability.
Output:

Sentience Level: Ranges from 0 to 100, indicating the estimated sentience level based on the fuzzy logic rules.
